## Overview

Founded in 2021, UbitEx has always placed users at its core, adhering to the mission of lowering the barriers to digital finance. The platform actively promotes the legalization and compliance of the cryptocurrency market. To date, UbitEx has already obtained compliance operation licenses from Canada (MSB), Australia (AUSTRAC), Nigeria (SCUML), and the United States (MSB), providing a secure and reliable trading environment for its users.

In 2024, UbitEx completed an investment of £30 million to acquire 60% of the shares of the UK GCG.L Main Board Company by BlackRock, successfully achieving a reverse takeover and listing on the London Stock Exchange's main board. This milestone marks UbitEx's transformation from an innovative cryptocurrency platform to a significant global financial ecosystem player. To further enhance user participation and protect their rights, UbitEx launched the GCGL token, a digital representation of its listed company shares, serving as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the Web3 ecosystem.

Motivation

- **Bridging Traditional Shares and the Web3 Ecosystem:** As global acceptance of digital assets grows, many cryptocurrency platforms have yet to fully achieve the integration of traditional finance with the Web3 ecosystem. Through the issuance of GCGL tokens, UbitEx aims to create an innovative platform that meets the needs of traditional investors while catering to the expectations of Web3 users.

- **Redefining User Rights:** GCGL holders not only gain shareholder rights in the publicly listed company but can also directly participate in the platform’s development and decision-making through staking and governance mechanisms. This model elevates UbitEx from a simple trading platform to a co-built ecosystem shared by its users.

- **Supporting Sustainable Platform Growth:** The issuance and staking mechanisms of GCGL are designed to support long-term economic growth. Through stable daily yields, referral rewards, and direct ties to shareholder rights, GCGL enhances the liquidity and stability of the platform's financial ecosystem.


## Evolution of GCGL

- **From Acquisition to Token Issuance:** Following the acquisition of GCG.L, UbitEx launched GCGL as a tokenized representation of 30% of the listed company’s shares. GCGL is not just an investment tool for cryptocurrency enthusiasts but also a means for users to directly participate in the platform’s growth and share in its dividend returns.

- **Gradual Ecosystem Integration:** GCGL empowers users to stake tokens for daily yields, participate in referral reward programs for greater returns, and strengthen the platform’s financial stability. This integration injects new vitality into the ecosystem, supporting long-term growth and sustainability.

- **Future Direction:** UbitEx plans to continuously enhance the functionality and market value of GCGL by introducing multi-chain support, upgrading smart contracts, and integrating deeper with traditional financial markets.

In 2024, an AI Intelligent Assistant - FlyLeopard features were implemented, which was won recognition from multiple well-know venture capital institutions. 

It received funding led by **ETORO GROUP PTY LTD**, with participation such as **Blockchain Capital, BlackRock, Crystal Capital, Digital Currency Group, Draper Associates, True Ventures, Galaxy Digital, and Protocol Ventures.**
